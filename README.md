🏦 Bank Management System (Java)

This project is a Bank Management System built in Java, demonstrating the use of Multithreading, Synchronization, and the Collection Framework.
It manages essential banking operations such as creating accounts, depositing money, withdrawing money, checking balances, and transferring funds.

🔧 Key Features

Java Collection Framework (HashMap, ArrayList) used to store and manage account data efficiently.

Multithreading allows multiple banking operations to run simultaneously, simulating real-world concurrent user activity.

Synchronization ensures thread-safe transactions, preventing issues like inconsistent balances during simultaneous deposits or withdrawals.

Clean and modular code structure for easy understanding and extension.
